# 1. Objectives of the Scenario

In this scenario we will ensure that you are starting of with a working application deployed in a Docker container. You could also run the application outside a container to more accurately simulate a n-Tier application, but since there are not that much difference in the deployment, we will jump right into it.

The application relies on a PostgreSQL database, which will also be deployed as a Docker container.

# 2. Technology & Patterns

Technology stack for this scenario:

* Docker
* Python
  * Flask web framework
* PostgreSQL Database Server

Important patterns to consider in this scenario:

* n-Tier architecture
* REST services
  * OpenAPI v3
