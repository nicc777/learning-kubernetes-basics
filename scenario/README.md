# 1. Objectives of the Scenario

Create a private Docker registry to push new builds to.

# 2. Technology & Patterns

There are many scenarios within the context of organizations where you would prefer to not expose your Docker images to public repositories. For this reason, hosting a private registry makes a lot of sense.

In this scenario, a private registry will be created according to the [Docker private registry documentation](https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/) and the `CI` pipeline in the `jenkins` branch will be updated to publish new images to this registry.

# 3. Step-by-Step Demo Walk Through

The steps are fairly basic since Docker already has a out-of-the-box solution for quickly setting up a registry.

## 3.1. Starting the Docker Registry Service

Run the following command:

```bash
(venv) $ docker run -d -p 0.0.0.0:5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2
```

__Note__: I have setup the registry to listen on the Ethernet interface in order to expose the service to my entire LAN. You may need to adjust this to suite your needs.

__Security Note__: The [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/) has a lot more detail around various scenarios, including TLS certificates and authentication. Again, adjust for your needs.

## 3.2. Adjusting Jenkins to push newly built images to the registry

On the `Server`, in order for the Docker CLI (client app) to talk to this specific registry, we need to configure the client to allow HTTP communications. If you do not do that, you may see the following error in your build logs:

```text
Get https://192.168.0.160:5000/v2/: http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client
```

In order to do that, you must edit the config file `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. My config file looks like this:

```json
{
    "debug": false,
    "insecure-registries" : [
	    "localhost:5000",
	    "127.0.0.1:5000",
	    "192.168.0.160:5000"
    ]
}
```

__Note__: You may need to do this on every system that need to connect to the private registry

__Note__: Not sure if it's 100% necessary, but I did restart the Docker daemon. When you do that, make sure both the registry and jenkins are running again:

```bash
$ docker container ls
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                              NAMES
abd1bed6bc30        registry:2          "/entrypoint.sh /etc…"   51 minutes ago      Up 16 seconds       0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp                             registry
85b71ca6fed1        jenkins-custom      "/sbin/tini -- /usr/…"   28 hours ago        Up 1 second         0.0.0.0:50000->50000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8085->8080/tcp   jenkins-coolapp-builder
```

## 3.3. Testing the build

In order to test a build, you may need to force a build. Assuming you have attempted a previous Jenkins build, you have two options:

1. Delete the `workspace` and manually run a build again (this will rebuild both the base and app images - takes a bit longer, but perfectly ok); or
2. Reset the checksum file used by the build script (shown below):

```bash
$ docker exec -it jenkins-coolapp-builder bash
jenkins@85b71ca6fed1:/$ cd workspace/cool-app-service-build/app-src/
jenkins@85b71ca6fed1:~/workspace/cool-app-service-build/app-src$ echo "blabla" > docker_coolapp_checksum 
jenkins@85b71ca6fed1:~/workspace/cool-app-service-build/app-src$ exit
```

And now you can rebuild again manually. The build log (on Jenkins), should look something like this:

```text
   .

## 3.4. Verifying the published image

To verify the image, we must first ensure we remove any local images or left overs from previous build:

```bash
$ docker container ls --all | grep coolapp-rest-service
5624ddf8b499        c39dc72ff2f3                "gunicorn -w 1 -b 0.…"    3 days ago          Exited (0) 3 days ago                                                         coolapp-rest-service
$ docker container rm coolapp-rest-service
coolapp-rest-service

```

So now we only have the one in image in the private registry. 

First, ensure it is available by listing the content of the registry:

```bash
curl http://192.168.0.160:5000/v2/_catalog
{"repositories":["cool-app"]}
```

__Note__: If you are using the Enterprise version of Docker, you have the [docker registry](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/registry/) commands to work with in order to inspect and work with remote registries.

Next, try pulling the image (I did this on my `Workstation` to test):

```bash
$ docker pull 192.168.0.160:5000/cool-app 
Using default tag: latest

# 4. Scenario Discussion

In this scenario we created a private Docker registry and modified our `CI` build to push newly built images to this private registry. All the parts from a `CI` perspective is now in place, **_BUT_** there is still one critical component of `CI` missing and that is around all the unit testing. The application may still have many bugs and without unit tests, there is no way for Jenkins to know if the build will be successful once deployed.

Refer to the [main README](../README.md) in the `master` branch to see which scenarios will cater for Unit Testing (this was not known at the time of completing this piece. FIXME ) 

## 4.1 Trail-Map Progress

| Category                               | Technologies & Patterns Used | Progress and other notes |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Containers (Docker)                    | Docker | Current application and database have been containerized |
| CI/CD                                  | Jenkins | The `CI` component now build and pushes an image to a private registry. Still outstanding: unit testing, coverage verification etc. and then the `CD` portion obviously. |
| Orchestration & Application Definition | n/a                          | not started yet          |

## 4.2 Cloud-Native Principles Progress

| Factor                        | Progress and Discussion |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Code Base                     | Source code is tracked in Git. Each version will have it's own branch. Each version can be independently built and deployed. |
| Dependencies                  | As part of the containerization effort, all dependencies are defined in the base and main application Docker files. There is still potential for finding a more lightweight base image to start with. The approach takes was to use the base Docker configuration to install all required software and dependencies. This image is typically build once as it will take the most time to build. The application Docker image is essentially just an installation of the latest Python application package and the build is relatively quick and is perfectly geared to be done many times. |
| Configurations                | Configuration is now done entirely through environment variable defined in the Docker configuration files. Configuration parameters can be set when launching the application. |
| Backing Services              | The database server has also been containerized. The application is simple enough to not rely too much on database versions and therefore almost any version of PostgreSQL can be used. Changing from PostgreSQL to something else is relatively easy as long as that something else is supported by [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org) and only minor code changes will then be required. If this will happen often (which it shouldn't), more configuration options and a more dynamic dependency system can be considered. |
| Build, Release, Run           | The `CI` portion of the `CI/CD` pipeline have been implemented with a Jenkins build that will produce an application Docker image on the `Server`. The image is pushed to a Docker registry. |
| Processes                     | No active effort have been made to ensure the application is truly stateless. Future testing will prove this and the application will be adjusted accordingly. At the moment the application should be able to run with multiple instances. |
| Port Binding                  | This is considered completed as the application is hosted in the container and exposed via [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org). |
| Concurrency                   | Untested but assumed to not be a problem. Will revisit during more testing in future scenarios. |
| Disposability                 | Untested but assumed to not be a problem. Will revisit during more testing in future scenarios. |
| Dev/Prod Parity               | No progress yet         |
| Logging                       | Logs are now logged to a file as well as `STDOUT`, and can be accessed via the Docker API. No log events are published yet and more work remain. |
| Admin Processes               | No progress yet         |
| API First                     | Through the use of [connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) the application have been implemented with an API first principle from the start. This is considered DONE. |
| Telemetry                     | No progress yet         |
| Authentication/ Authorization | No progress yet. The application currently completely trusts the Application Server and relies on external configuration to prevent other unauthorized services connecting to it. |
