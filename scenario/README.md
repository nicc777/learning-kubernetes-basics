# 1. Objectives of the Scenario

Create a private Docker registry to push new builds to.

# 2. Technology & Patterns

There are many scenarios within the context of organizations where you would prefer to not expose your Docker images to public repositories. For this reason, hosting a private registry makes a lot of sense.

In this scenario, a private registry will be created according to the [Docker private registry documentation](https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/) and the `CI` pipeline in the `jenkins` branch will be updated to publish new images to this registry.

In each scenario we will map our progress against the Cloud-Native Trail Map and against the Cloud-Native Principles.
