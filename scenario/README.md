# 1. Objectives of the Scenario

In this scenario a release branch will be set-up with monitoring/triggers for changes in the release branch.

Essentially whenever there is an approved pull request (PR) into the release branch, the automation needs to kick in.

What needs to be build is the following:

1. If the Base Docker image have changed, build a new base
2. Run the application build script that will also produce a new application image

# 2. Technology & Patterns

For this scenario a build server is required and since [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io) is still widely used, I will stick to this trusty old workhorse.



# 3. Step-by-Step Demo Walk Through

These steps are executed on a system where you will host your CI/CD pipeline. For me that is on my `Server` and the commands shown are executed from that server.

I will deploy the official [Docker version of Jenkins](https://hub.docker.com/_/jenkins/).

## 3.1 Prepare a docker environment

In order to run Jenkins in Docker, a number of steps need to be taken since we want to build docker images from Jenkins, which itself will be running in Docker.

Following the guidance from the official Jenkins documentation, you can relatively safely run the following:

```bash
(venv) $ docker network create jenkins
(venv) $ docker volume create jenkins-docker-certs
(venv) $ docker volume create jenkins-data
(venv) $ docker volume inspect jenkins-data
[
    {
        "CreatedAt": "2020-05-03T12:01:18+02:00",
        "Driver": "local",
        "Labels": {},
        "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/jenkins-data/_data",
        "Name": "jenkins-data",
        "Options": {},
        "Scope": "local"
    }
]
```

The following is the required bit to enable Jenkins to build docker images:

```bash
docker container run \
  --name jenkins-docker \
  --rm \
  --detach \
  --privileged \
  --network jenkins \
  --network-alias docker \
  --env DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=/certs \
  --volume jenkins-docker-certs:/certs/client \
  --volume jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \
  --publish 2376:2376 \
  docker:dind
```

TODO ~ complete....

## 3.2 Start the Jenkins Server

Start the Jenkins server and give it some time do properly initialize. 

```bash
(venv) $ docker run --name jenkins \
-p 0.0.0.0:8085:8080 \
-p 0.0.0.0:50000:50000 \
-m 4096M --memory-swap 4096M \
--cpu-quota 50000 \
-v jenkins:/var/jenkins_home \
-d jenkins
a8960c40d74d984680ff5258f4dccc4184914ae91664eaadc5a110d244cf2d07
(venv) $ docker logs -f jenkins
   <lot of output>
   .
